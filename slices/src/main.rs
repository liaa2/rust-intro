//Another data type that does not have ownership is the slice. Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

    //create an iterator over the array of bytes using the iter method, it returns each element in a collection and that enumerate wraps the result of iter and returns each element as part of a tuple instead
