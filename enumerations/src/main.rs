    Advantages of enums over structs:
    - attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an extra struct.

    - each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data.

enum Message {

    Move { x: i32, y: i32 }, // Move includes an anonymous struct inside it
    Write(String), // Write includes a single String
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32), //ChangeColor includes three i32 values.
}

// which is the same as using structs
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
