/*
    We define a module by starting with the mod keyword and then specify the name of the module (in this case, front_of_house) and place curly brackets around the body of the module. Inside modules, we can have other modules, as in this case with the modules hosting and serving. Modules can also hold definitions for other items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, or functions.

    module tree for the structure:
    crate
    └── front_of_house
        ├── hosting
        │   ├── add_to_waitlist
        │   └── seat_at_table
        └── serving
            ├── take_order
            ├── serve_order
            └── take_payment
*/

mod font_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }


    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
